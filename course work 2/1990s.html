          <p>Overalls with the strap down were severly popular in the 90s, worn with a bold stable shirt underneath to giver it a pop of pattern or colour. SKate tees also became popular in this time, with brands like Alien Workshop, Spitfire and Thrasher; which then followed with teh uprise in popularity with roller blades. Bike shorts became a trend of the 90s as hoop shorts were too short men would wear them underneath, until all of a sudden they became their own trend. Raiders Caps were a popular accessory amont West Coast Rap fans as the fans followed teh artist fashion. Neon windbreakers were like the magic capes of the 90s, you put one on and your'e instantly the coolest guy in the room. </p>
