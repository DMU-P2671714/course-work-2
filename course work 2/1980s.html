          <p class="p70">When thinking of 80’s fashion, the words ‘big and bright’ surely sums it up. It was a decade of big hair, shoulder pads, large and dramatic earring types, acid wash jeans and eye-straining fabric colors and patterns. Fashion trends in the 1980s were about materialistic values and flaunting wealth. Having the right clothes meant spending extra money to buy designer labels and sports goods with a brand logo. Glossy designer adverts such as Calvin Klein's and the launch of music channel MTV in 1981 led to a greater exposure of denim trends than in previous decades. In the mid-1980s the three influences of music, fashion and TV all came together in a striking commercial by a UK advertising agency.</p>
