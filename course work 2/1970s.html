        <p class="p70">Individual style, falres, platforms, fringing and suade dominated the 70s. The Boho trend was popular in this decade with peasant blouses, tie dye, bell bottoms beign staples of this. Joni Mitchell was undoubtedly one of the 70s ultimate style icons. She wore tie dye blouses, earth-godess hair and kaftans like no other, ususally completing her trademark look with bare feet. </p>

          <p class="p70">Cher released a whopping 10 albums in the 70s meaning, quite simply, that she was absolutely everywhere. From more-is-more prints to epic perms, she trialled every trend the decade had to offer with gusto, meaning she was seventies fashion personified. Through out the decade Cher went through almost every trend, including Boho. She often wore bold, flower print, flared co-ords but then would contrast this with a bedazzled, sequin, floor length dress. </p>

          <p class="p70">The late David Bowieâ€™s alter ego skewed ideas about gender and fashion in the seventies; the star would perform in spray on leotards, foil flares and a whole lotta face paint. The ultimate style chameleon, Bowie transformed his look again and again throughout his career, but this will always be the moment where he changed 1970s fashion (and beyond) forever.</p>
